## Description
This is a implemetation of mobile-ssd for face detection written by keras.

## prepare data
1. You are advised to use CUDA-compatible GPUs to train the model.
2. Download [WIDER Face](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/WIDERFace/) from Official Website , and put it into face_data folder in [face_generator.py](https://github.com/bruceyang2012/face-detection-with-mobilenet-ssd/raw/master/face_generator.py).

## train
1. Follow [face_train.ipynb](https://github.com/bruceyang2012/face-detection-with-mobilenet-ssd/raw/master/face_train.ipynb) step by step. You can change the parameters for better performance.
2. [wider_train_small.npy](https://github.com/bruceyang2012/face-detection-with-mobilenet-ssd/raw/master/wider_train_small.npy) and [wider_val_small.npy](https://github.com/bruceyang2012/face-detection-with-mobilenet-ssd/raw/master/wider_val_small.npy) are made to testing the network. If you don't have enough gpu resources, you can also use them for training.

## test
Here are some testing results. It seems good but improvement is still needed.
